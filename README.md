# U
Front end jQuery library to build frontend for webapps and websites faster.
Highly customizable, with lots of different features, and yet almost any feature can be implemented in a single line of code ;)

Complete documentation available at: https://devx.merciglobal.com/apis/u/


U offers multiple plugins like 
      Modals, <br>
      Toasts, <br>
      seamless Page navigations, \n
      Hero animations,
      Network Logging,
      Tabs 
      ... and so many more features
      

Getting it all in a single library means that you dont need to reply on importing multiple different libraries. All the tools perfectly blend each other to make your app look beautiful and pixel perfect.


Constructive suggestions are always welcome.
